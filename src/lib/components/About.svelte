            I transitioned to IT as a web developer in 2021 after completing my degree, and this career shift quickly turned into a passion.
             My interest in coding deepened when I learned <b class="text-[#f96743]"> Svelte </b> , and I began my professional journey with a three-month contract job at
              <strong class="text-primary first-letter:text-2xl inline-block">  Qbtrix </strong>, 
             a product-based company, where I mastered <b class="text-primary">  Tailwind CSS </b> and <b class="text-[#F96743]"> SvelteKit </b>.
        </p>
        <p class="tracking-normal text-pretty">
            With <strong> 1.5 years of experience </strong>, I am now working on <strong class="text-primary first-letter:text-2xl inline-block"> Lulugram </strong>, another product-based company, where I worked on Svelte-based frontends and expanded my skill set to include
             <strong class="text-primary">  React Native, 
            AI, server-side development, PWA, and Capacitor </strong>. My performance earned me three appraisals within a year, doubling my salary.
        </p>
        <p class="tracking-normal text-pretty">
            I have also completed over <strong class="text-[#f96743]">  50 design-to-code projects</strong>, converting Figma designs into responsive Tailwind HTML, and hosted some of these on Netlify. 
            Coding is more than a profession for me—it’s a passion that drives my constant growth. I am particularly interested in full-stack mobile and AI development, 
            and I strive to create impactful and innovative solutions.
